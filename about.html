			<br>
			<p>Hi, I'm Josh Williams. I'm 25 years old, and have recently decided to change 
			careers, having previous experience in management and business administration. 
			I started my career moving into a business administration role with a local small 
			business where I developed the skills needed to lead people and apply my business 
			acumen knowledge to a large organisation. I then moved into a management position 
			at Westfield, leading a team of 60 casual staff across departments like valet, 
			information desks, and car park. As much as I enjoyed the opportunity, I couldn’t 
			ignore my passion for computers and IT for long, and that’s when I decided to study.</p>  
			<br>
			<p>I have lived most of my live in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne, and moved out 
			of home when I was 19. I’ve lived close to the city, but I grew up in the Pakenham area 
			on the outskirts of metro Melbourne, and I love the community and growing infrastructure, 
			despite the longer commutes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I love to listen to many different musicians, rarely skipping songs, but what I love to 
			listen to on a Sunday afternoon is sound tracks from movies, namely Interstellar, and the 
			suites of Hans Zimmer. This kind of existential and biopic-based music ties into the movies 
			I love as well, again Interstellar, but also documentaries by David Attenborough, sci-fi 
			fiction like Dune, and a lesser known movie The King on Netflix that starred Timothee Chalamet 
			and Robert Pattinson. Recently I’ve had a soft spot for political war films, with Oppenheimer 
			being the most recent, and my all-time favourite movie Darkest Hour, based around Winston 
			Churchill during World War II.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Hello, My name is Brayden Hall. I am currently a student at Swinburne University
			studying a diploma of IT. I have the intention of continuing this into a Bachelor
			of Comp Sci. Previously I have been an Education Support worker at a high school
			local to my area. I am hoping to enter into a more tech centric job after I
			finish my study.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I was born in Melbourne and moved shortly after to Seymour, where I have lived
			up until this point. I have 2 dogs, 2 cats, and many more pets. Favorite movies
			include Spiderman into/across the spiderverse, How to train your dragon and many
			other older Pixar and Dreamworks movies that I grew up watching. My favorite Book series
			include Harry Potter, Eragon and Cradle.</p>
			<br>
			<p>My favorite places I have visited are Japan during the cherry blossom season,
			It was incredible to see so many cherry trees in full bloom and some of their
			temples and historic buildings are built to an absurd scale. And New Zealand
			during the summer, Where you can walk without fear because they dont have any
			snakes! Not to mention the incredible sights.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Hi! My name is Nicolas Rivera and I’m a student at Swinburne University
			currently doing a diploma of IT. I’m in my 20s and I have some experience
			working in the film industry as an FX artist. I’ve worked on a couple of movies
			such as the recent Napoleon (2023) film, Strays (2023) and Hocus Pocus 2. As
			much as I enjoyed parts of the job, I’m hoping to pivot my career into a more
			programming orientated role hence why I’m studying computer science at
			Swinburne!</p>
			<br>
			<p>I was originally born in the capital city of Chile, Santiago but I moved very early to
			Australia so most of my memories are from the down under. I grew up and
			moved around a bit in the south eastern suburbs of Melbourne. My favourite
			place where I lived was Belgrave. A beautiful area further out from the CBD, it
			had a lot of gardens and a lovely small community. Nearby you could even catch
			the puffing billy train which is thankfully back in service after COVID.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have a mish mash of favourite music genres and bands. You can never go
			wrong with Daft Punk or Gorrilaz. But some of my favourite bands are Caravan
			Palace, Lorn, Bonobo, Aussie composer Kevin Penkin and The Cat Empire.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have so many favourite movies it’s always hard to pick one. I will always have a
			soft spot for both 2D and 3D animation films, I love Ghibli films such as Howl’s
			Moving Castle and movies from Pixar like the Incredibles sparked my interest in
			getting into the animation industry. My favourite movies from recent years tend to
			be more sci fi orientated such as Annihilation and Blade Runner 2049 but I love
			Spiderman into the Spiderverse and Everything Everywhere All At Once (highly
			recommend this one if you ever have the chance to watch it!).</p>

			<br>
			<p>Hi, my name is Cooper Simester. I'm 23 years old studying a Diploma of IT at Swinburne. 
			I first started at Swinburne in 2019, with an initial focus of Physical and Digital 
			Games Design. During COVID in 2020 I realised while it was a passion, this wasn't 
			a field in which I wanted a career and started to lean towards something closer to 
			cyber security or data analytics. Since 2022 I have been studying IT part-time.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have an extensive history in labour, currently being employed at a company called Credo
			in which I work nightshift performing shopfitting works for different Coles locations around
			Melbourne. I hope to transition to a more tech focused career following my completion of
			my Diploma.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have a 4 year old daughter named Astrid, who is in my full time care. The picture on this
			page is of us looking at Christmas lights along with my partner of 2½ years who also lives with 
			us. Her name is Angel.</p>
			<br>
			<p>One of Astrid's favourite things to do on the weekend is take the train into the city, whether we
			go to a museum or just walk around looking at different shops. She is (very) obsessed with Batman
			and we often watch cartoons together.</p>
			<br>
			<p>My interests in music are diverse, but both rap and indie are my favourite. My favourite album is
			Tyler the Creator's Flower Boy, and I had the chance to see him live earlier this year!</p>
			<br>
			<p>My favourite movies are Juno, Fight Club and Zathura.</p>
